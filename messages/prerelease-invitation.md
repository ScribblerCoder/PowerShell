# Prelease invitation

Hello PowerShell user. There are improvements underway to bring the
syntax highlighting for PS more in line with the other Sublime Text
languages. This means your color scheme should start highlighting
similar concepts the same colors as you are used to in those other
languages.

It is not perfect. And, as such, I'm inviting adventurous ST users to
try it out ahead of time. If that sounds like you, open your Package
Control Settings (usually `Cmd/Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`, "Preferences: Package
Control Settings") and add `"PowerShell"` to the array for
`install_prereleases` in the right-hand pane.

If you find bugs, especially egregious ones that break code
highlighting further down in the file, please mention them at
https://github.com/SublimeText/PowerShell/issues and include "v4" in
the title.

Thank you. Be well.
